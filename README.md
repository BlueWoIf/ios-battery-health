# iPhone Battery Health checker
basic ios battery health stats from the Analytics file<br><br>
due to iOS 18 limiting shortcuts' ability to read big files (or due to the Analytics file becoming too big over time), none of the battery stats shortcuts work on my phone, so i made this html-js code to parse it and calculate some values<br><br>
to access the analytics file: Settings -> Privacy&Security -> Analytics&Improvements -> Analytics Data, here search for the latest Analytics-... file (latest indicated by the date in the filename, e.g. Analytics-2025-05-20-...)<br><br>
make sure that in Settings -> Privacy&Security -> Analytics&Improvements the "share iphone and watch analytics" is enabled
